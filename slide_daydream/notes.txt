Fix Broken Time
Is your time not being recorded? Fix this issue by holding this         button. Your next run will replace your record.

Your next run will replace your record.

1. Strafe Jumping\nEquip your melee and move diagonally to go the fastest.\n\nDescend the ladder behind you to return to the spawn area. Avoid the clouds!
2. Slide Hopping\nCrouch just before hitting the ground to slide. Then, release crouch and immediately jump to hop.
3. Slide Strafing\nFace in the direction you want to go while you slide.
4. Slipping\nOnce you reach the first dirt platform, slide off the edge instead of hopping and then slide hop from the next.
5. Ducking\nCrouch mid-air to duck.
6. Air Strafing\nMove mid-air to air strafe.
7. Braking\nControl your speed by changing weapons, aiming down sights, air strafing, crouching or slide hopping differently.
8. Ramps\nTo slide hop off of a front-facing ramp, slide until you reach the top and then hop. For side-facing ramps, slide hop normally.
9. Driveby\nShoot the balloon to temporarily remove the block with the same colour.
10. Altogether\nAltogether now!
